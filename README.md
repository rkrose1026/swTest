# swTest

This is just a thrown together test.

Built rather crudly but utilizing a stripped down format of how I like to connect to databases.

## Requirements
    there are MySQL Procedures that are necessary, they are located in the .sql file in the config/datamodel

    Also a user is required in the MySQL, that data is in the db.php which is in config/includes
